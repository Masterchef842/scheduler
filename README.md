# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

During a busy workday, it can become overwhelming to keep track of all you have to do, and to do list are good at telling you what, but not when. This website solves that problem by allowing you to block off time for activites throughout the workday, making sure you get done what you need to get done when you need to get it done.

## Installation

Just follow this link: https://masterchef842.github.io/scheduler/
## Usage

Enter your task in the text box next to the listed hour and click the floppy disk to save the event to that time slot.
